![Counts of participants by participant age of entry and proband age of diagnosis](afig1-bw.png)

The solid diagonal lines correspond to equality.

<!-- Source: fig1.Rmd -->


![Our Cox model includes a time-dependent covariate, which is exemplified here for a hypothetical participant, whose sister was diagnosed at age 57 (=d). This covariate, Z(t) = exp(-0.5*((t - d )/$\sigma)^2$), is 1 when the age of the i$^{th}$ participant, t, is the same as the proband age of diagnosis, d, and allows the relative hazard in a Cox model to increase up to d then smoothly decrease for t beyond that. The “scaling factor”, $\sigma$, determines the steepness of ascent and descent and is itself a parameter to be fitted to the data. The coefficient for Z(t) in a Cox regression model sets the maximum ln(hazard ratio) in relation to proximity to the proband’s age at diagnosis.](fig1bw.png)

![Estimated breast cancer hazard ratios by difference between participant's age and proband age of diagnosis for three fitted models. The dotted line shows the fitted curve for the hazard ratio based on the covariate from Figure 2. The solid line shows a step function of the hazard ratio based on categories of closeness of participant's age to the proband's age at diagnosis. The dash-dotted line shows a fit based on a cubic spline of the age difference on the horizontal axis.](fig2-ms-bw.png)

\vspace*{-2mm}
Note: The step function and the spline provide meaningful shape estimates for the functional contribution to the hazard, but are not fully identifiable under a Cox model because the baseline, age-dependent hazard function can absorb any additive constant. Thus, the contribution of the spline and the step function for nearness must be considered to be identified up to an additive constant. For convenience of display in this figure, we have arbitrarily scaled the hazard ratios both to be 1.1 for the youngest interval that is an approximation of the average relative hazard.
